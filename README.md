=====================

MS Robotics Developer Studio Simulation with multiple entities controllable using voice commands via MS Kinect

Description
-----------

This is a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to provide input and a series of simulated robots that react to the provided input. The underlying code is built entirely in C# using various Microsoft Frameworks that allow for asynchronous concurrency and the building of services that interact with each other, in order to create rich, human controllable applications.

In this project, multiple robots are created in a simulated environment and controlled via voice commands through the Kinect audio sensor and speech recognition software. This particular application allows the various robots to be controlled individually and independently, without any interference in the backend functioning of the robots.
